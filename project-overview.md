# Project Overview

Project Name: Pizza Planetarium

Description: A unique web application that blends the wonder of astronomy with the comfort of pizza! Users can:
*   Create custom star maps showing celestial events visible from their location and time (simulated).
*   "Unlock" constellations by ordering specific pizza toppings (e.g., pepperoni unlocks Orion!).
*   Learn fun facts about space and pizza ingredients.
*   Use augmented reality (AR) to overlay constellations and pizza toppings onto the real night sky (simulated via the webcam).

Features:
*   Interactive Star Map: A beautiful, interactive star map that mocks celestial events based on user-provided location and time.
*   Pizza-Based Constellation Unlocks: Order a pizza with specific toppings to "unlock" constellations and access related information.
*   AR Stargazing with Pizza Toppings: Simulate an AR view that overlays constellations and pizza toppings onto the real world using the user's webcam.
*   Educational Content: Fun facts about constellations, planets, pizza ingredients, and the history of pizza.
*   Simulated Pizza Ordering: A mocked pizza ordering system that allows users to customize their pizza and "unlock" constellations.

Technology Stack:
*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
